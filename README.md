## 🧪 Demo Flow (Step-by-Step)
# Step 1️⃣ Clone & Open the Repository

From GitHub:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
code .


Open the folder in VS Code.

# Step 2️⃣ Enable GitHub Copilot

Open GitHub Copilot Chat

Select GPT-5.2-Open AI or Claude (Haiku/Sonnet) as the model

Ensure Copilot has access to workspace files

# Step 3️⃣ Understand prompts.txt

prompts.txt contains ordered instructions telling Copilot:

Which files to generate

In what sequence

What context to use

👉 This is the single control file for the demo

# Step 4️⃣ Requirement Phase (AI-Assisted)
Action

Open Copilot Chat and run:

“Execute the prompts in prompts.txt sequentially for the requirements folder.”

What AI Does

Reads 00_raw_input.md

Generates structured content across:

Problem statement

Goals

Scope

PRD

User stories

Acceptance criteria

Each file:

Uses prior files as context

Avoids hallucination (rules enforced in file headers)

Produces review-ready content

## 📈 Result:

Requirements preparation effort reduced by ~50–60%

# Step 5️⃣ Design Phase (HLD & LLD)
Action

After requirements are complete, ask:

“Re-read prompts.txt and execute the design phase prompts now.”

High-Level Design (HLD)

AI generates:

System architecture overview

Component boundaries

Data flow descriptions

Tech stack decisions

Non-functional requirements

Low-Level Design (LLD)

AI generates:

Component-level behavior

API contracts

Database schemas

Sequence flows

Error handling

Open design questions

## 📈 Result:

Design documentation generated faster with higher consistency and traceability.

# Step 6️⃣ Code Generation
Action

Ask Copilot:

“Generate the application code using the finalized PRD, HLD, and LLD.”

AI Responsibilities

Follow design constraints

Generate modular, readable code

Align with documented APIs and schemas

Human verifies correctness and feasibility.

# Step 7️⃣ AI-Assisted Code Review
Action

Ask Copilot:

“Perform a senior-engineer code review and generate a review report.”

AI checks for:

Code smells

Design violations

Performance issues

Security risks

Readability and maintainability

# Step 8️⃣ AI-Driven Refactoring
Action

After human review:

“Fix the issues identified in the code review and refactor the code.”

AI:

Applies minimal, safe changes

Preserves functionality

Improves structure

# Step 9️⃣ Run the Application

Human runs the application locally to ensure:

It builds successfully

Core flows work as expected

# Step 🔟 Automated Testing with AI (Playwright)
Action

Ask Copilot:

“Generate Playwright test cases for this application.”

## Test Coverage Includes

✅ Unit tests

✅ API tests

✅ UI functional tests

✅ User journey tests

✅ Navigation & click-flow tests

AI generates:

Test structure

Assertions

Test data

Reusable utilities

Tests are then executed locally.

## 📊 What This Demo Proves

AI can accelerate every SDLC phase

Productivity gains come from:

Reduced blank-page effort

Fewer clarification loops

Automated testing & review

Quality is preserved through:

Structured prompts

Human approval

Version control

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

AI does not replace engineers — it removes friction.
Engineers focus on decisions, not repetition.
